# Debian 11 (Bullseye) on the Dell XPS 15 9570

Here we go, another "howto install Linux" guide, with a bit of an unsolicited
history and rant thrown in to boot. So if the guide does not help you out too
much, perhaps I might just provide a bit of amusing reading.

### So why write this guide?

First of all, it seems I've come full circle. 20 Years ago (2001) I switched my
daily driver laptop from Windows(R) to Linux, in particular Debian. The 2.4 
series Kernel had just been released, and Linux on the desktop was looking 
promising because distributions were putting a lot of work into "packaging" not
just the core operating system, but a "suite" of opensource software, and
hardware support for _decent_ kit was fairly good.

This was a long way removed from my early days of running Linux on a desktop
class system. Although it was fun, and a great learning experience, installing
Linux (Slackware) from 3.5" floppy disks was not fun, and far too many hours
we're spent compiling kernels and X on a 486 in order to get Sound Blasters and
S3 VLB graphics cards working.
